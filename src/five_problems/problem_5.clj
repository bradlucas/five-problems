;; Problem 5

;; Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or
;; nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the
;; result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 - 5 + 67 - 8 + 9 = 100.

;; You are limited to one instance of each of the numbers from 1 to 9
;; The numbers are in order
;; The result must be 100

;; [1 + 2 + 34 - 5 + 67 - 8 + 9]
;; (range 1 10)
